# Loan Default
This project is conducted to identify the type of customer who is most likely not to default when a loan is granted so as to minimize the finicial loss of a loan company

### Data Source
[Loan Default](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmldas/loan-default-prediction)

### About the dataset
The dataset contains 5 columns including the index and target variable.
I used 3 columns for the prediction which are:
- Employed
- Bank Balance
- Annual Salary

I checked for multicollinearity using The VAriance Inflation Factor and all the values falls between 1 and 5.

#### Oversampling and Undersampling
I performed oversampling using the SMOTE method however there are so many other methods that you can use for oversampling and undersampling. 

#### Algorithms used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boost
- KNN
- Decision there

At the end i only choosed one and ploted the ROC and calculated the AUC which have a score of 91.2%

I hope will have a nice time on the notebook, feel free to reach out to me if nothing is clear.
